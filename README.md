<h1>Setting Netgear Router Time Limits</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a simple step-by-step tutorial on how to set your Netgear router time limits for WiFi use. I did this to prevent my children from staying up late sneaking WiFI access after their bedtime. As I am new to using technology beyond simple internet browser stuff this was a great lesson for me in internet security in my home to prevent abuse of the WiFi.

Note: First time setting up the router the temporary username and password is provided on the router.  <br/>

<br />
Fill in the Schedule Name if you wish, choose which days to block by clicking the appropriate boxes, then un-cklick the All Day box under Time of day to block. Then choose your hours to block in military time. I chose to start blocking at 22:00 or 10 PM and to End Blocking at 5:00 AM. Then click the green Apply tab and you are ready to go. <br/>
